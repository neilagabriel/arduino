IR test demo

This sketch tests the functionality of the infrared receiver. 

For compatibility with the robot demo sketch, use a universal 
remote control and select a Sony TV code. 

Choose the download based on the version of the Arduino integrated 
development environment (IDE) you are using.

The sketch is provided in a zip file archive; you need to unpack this archive into your 
Arduino sketch directory. This directory is where the Arduino stores the sketches you 
create and edit. The exact location depends on your operating system. On Windows XP, 
for example, it's located at My Documents\Arduino.

If you have Arduino 1.0 IDE, download the file labeled BYFR_IRTest_10.zip. If you have 
for pre-release Arduino IDE (0022 or later), download BYFR_IRTest.zip.

Then:

1. Close the Arduino IDE software, if it's running.
2. Open the BYFR_IRTest folder that you just downloaded and unpacked.
3. Inside the folder is another folder named IRremote. Move it to the sketch 
libraries folder (it's a directory within the Arduino sketch folder -- for example, My 
Documents\Arduino\libraries). If there isn't already a folder called libraries, create one.
4. Restart the Arduino IDE.
5. Verify that the IRremote library has been successfully installed by choosing Sketch-
>Import Library. You should see a reference to IRremote in the pull-down list.
6. Open the demo sketch.
*  For Arduino 1.0 IDE, open BYFR_IRTest_10.ino.
*  For Arduino pre-release, open BYFR_IRTest.pde.
